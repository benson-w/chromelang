# Highlight Translator

This is a chrome extension that takes selected text on a page and translates it
to a desired language. The motivation behind this project is to help me
learn japanese when browsing the web.

## Still To Do
* Remove Textbox
* Add translating API
* Add settings page
* ... so pretty much everything
